# Brain-Game This is an android app project that I started with the help of my friend, It was a problem statemnet for the SIH 22.
The idea for solving the problem was to create a single app with multiple brain-games/puzzles as a sub part of the application.
We started with adding Sudoku as the first puzzle game in the app.
This Sudoku contains three difficulty levels and multiple levels in each of that.
We also created a mutiplayer chess game for two players to play online but,
before we could integrate the externally created chess game we faced some difficulties with
the selection of the game for furthur levels of the SIH.
Thus, In the end we stopped working on the app halfway through.
